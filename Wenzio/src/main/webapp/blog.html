                    Better known for Virupaksha Temple, the iconic Chariot, and the ruins of the Vijayanagara Empire,
                     the historical city Hampi has a lot more to offer to travellers. In the era of experiential and slow travel, 
                     Hampi is a place to get immersed in. Set-in in a splendid rugged boulder landscape, Hampi was once the capital city of mighty Vijayanagara. The ruins of this iconic location evoke the memories of the grandeur of the royalty of the time.

Nandi Hills also called Nandi Durga is arguably the most popular weekend destination for the city crowd of Bengaluru. The rivers North Palar, South Pennar, Chitravathi, Arkavathi and Papaghni take their birth at Nandi Hills. It has been under the control of Paleyagars of Chikkaballapura, Tipu Sultan, Marathas and finally the British. It was called ‘Nandigiri’ in the ancient inscriptions. The bracing air and serene environs of Nandi Hills, perched at an altitude of 4850 feet above sea level, provided the British and Tipu Sultan with an idyllic summer retreat. The weather at the hills is pleasant throughout the year and here, you can take leisurely strolls. Adventure sports lovers can try their hand at parasailing. An ideal trekking destination, the prominent places which can be visited from Nandi hills are to the north-west-Channakeshava Betta (4762 ft), south-west Brahmagiri (4657 ft),
 north, Skandagiri (4749 ft) south the steep precipice and the well at the bottom called “Shravana Tirtha.”

                    One of the largest cathedrals in India, St. Philomena’s Cathedral in Mysuru is a remarkable example of Gothic architecture. The majestic church, built to honour the memory of Saint Philomena, a Latin Catholic Saint of the Roman Catholic Church, draws inspiration from the beautiful Cologne Cathedral of Germany. Remains of St Philomena are preserved at the cathedral. St. Philomena’s Cathedral is one of the tallest churches in Asia.

St Philomena’s Cathedral was built by Maharaja of Mysuru Mummudi Krishnaraja Wadiyar in 1843 in memory of 4th-century saint and martyr St. Philomena. The cathedral was built as a gift to a large number of European populations residing in Mysuru in the 19th century. 
As the need for a larger church was felt due to the growing population of Europeans, the foundation for the new church was laid in October 1933 by the then king of Mysuru, Krishnarajendra Wodeyar.

                    Spend time in tranquillity amid the coffee estates of the most sought and one of the best hill stations in South India. The aromas of coffee, melodious chirping of birds, misty hills, traditional Coorgi cuisine, and beautiful valleys are more than enough reasons to visit Coorg during winter. Coorg, the land of Kodavas should be visited for its temples, monasteries, coffee estates, wildlife, weather, and of course the mountain views. 
                    Just 250 km away from Bangalore crossing via dense forests and hairpin bends, Coorg tops the list of places to visit in Karnataka during winter.
